				Implemented tasks
	list #1, task #3: 2*
	list #1, task #5: 3*
	list #1, task #8: 4* + 1* = 5*
		+ min spanning forest (+1*)
		+ storing different data in vertices, edges
		+ measuring "system"
	list #2, task #2: 3*
		+ build perpendicular line to other line via some point
		+ build projection of point on line
		+ distance between two points
		+ Chose n different points from the line
		+ bulild line by two points

	Also implemented:
	 - unit tests for Queue, Stack, Deque, Priority Queue
	 - random generation for each data structure

Total number of *: 2 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 13*
